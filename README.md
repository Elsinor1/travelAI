# Avivi - AI travel agency

### This web application was made as a final project for CS50W course provided by Harvard University.

## Description

**Avivi** is a web application that generates travel offers tailored to users' preferences. After completing a user's travel profile form, the application creates custom travel offers that fit the user's preferences, including recommending suitable destinations. Avivi connects to the _Amadeus API_ to fetch real-time flight offers with prices and availability. It also recommends a three-day itinerary, which includes sightseeing, activities, and dining recommendations generated using the _ChatGPT API_. Itinerary is complemented with beatiful images retrieved from Trip advisot API. All retrieved or generated data is stored in Django ORM models using an _SQLite_ database.

### Distinctiveness and Complexity

Avivi is unique due to it's usage of data from external API's, it connects to Amadeus, ChatGPT and Trip Advisor. Processing real time data it creates travel offer "on spot". Application is written on more that 1500 lines of custom code. It has 22 custom django ORM models.

#### Note: In order to run this application you need to setup enviroment variable for Amadeus API. You can use my test setup:

AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID=SGVrXP6enprnQv4OU8K9mgo0EVUKMmzs

AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET=O4DORD8RgfrTkCP5
